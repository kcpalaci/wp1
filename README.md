This program is meant to take in a text file and return an encrypted version by reversing the text within the file. This reverse cypher process is applicable for text of any size. The program is run from the command line given the name of the original text file and the destination of the encrypted file. The program is adjusted to smoothly handle any errors posed by test cases.
